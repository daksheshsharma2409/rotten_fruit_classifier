# rotten_fruit_classifier
A fast and lightweight web app that uses a TensorFlow Lite model to identify the type of fruit (e.g., Mango, Apple, Orange) and predict whether itâ€™s good (fresh) or bad (rotten). Built using Python, Flask, and Bootstrap, the app runs entirely in-browser and supports image file for predictions.
